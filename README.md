# Logistic-Multiclass-Regression
Classification Project with Multiple Logistic Regression

In this project, I prepared a classification dataset using scikit-learn. The primary objective was to implement Multiple Logistic Regression to predict the target variable based on several features.

Key steps in this project include:

* Data Preparation: Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to ensure it was suitable for the classification task.

* Multiple Logistic Regression: Implemented multiple logistic regression to model the relationship between the independent variables and the categorical target.

* Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using various metrics to determine its accuracy and effectiveness.

* This project provides insights into applying multiple logistic regression for solving classification problems, along with model evaluation techniques.
